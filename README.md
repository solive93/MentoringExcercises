# Mentoring

This is a repository aimed to share katas and small projects with the coders I'm co-mentoring **with the invaluable help of 
my collegue and friend @sofiacarballo**. This repo was cloned from my old GitHub Account (repo originally created on 2020).

### 1st Session: String Calculator Kata

### 2nd & Third Sessions: Hateful Eight: (8 mini-exercises)

### 4th Session: JacksonFive: (5 mini-xercises)
